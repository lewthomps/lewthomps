    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p class="text">
        I collaborated with my brother and created ten original animated shorts. The idea behind this project was to explore a creative feedback system. He sends me animations, I respond with sound, and so on. It was also a creative outlet to work together in our artistic pursuits. He developed all the animations, and I composed all the music and sound. I chose a select few works that evoke the strongest parts of our collaboration.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p class="text2">
        My goal as the composer was to try and establish a connective tissue between each miniature environment. To achieve that effect, I decided to use the same combination of instruments as a creative limitation and an opportunity for experimentation. For example, what would the space around this meditative crystal god sound like? How do the knobs and scales of this abstract control system communicate? Each functional question came with another question about emotional capacity. Does this jet want you to feel like itâ€™s just as epic as Top Gun? Is the traveling pink orb lost, or is it studying these decaying shapes? By developing mini-narratives as the foundation for each of my compositions, I could choose sounds that highlighted the movement and motivations of the characters. This approach was particularly rewarding when working with animated loops because my musical choices created a feeling of gradual development over time.
