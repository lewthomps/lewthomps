    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p class="text">
        In collaboration with my friend and colleague, Tae Parvit, we created a 15-minute multi-media installation. This project was the third part of a series of works about displacing natural landscapes and redefining them in a gallery space. Plunge was meant to emulate landing in the plunge pool at the bottom of the waterfall, an end and a beginning.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p class="text2">
        I approached this piece by interpreting the audio form of displacement. I recorded on a piano I played in my family home, manipulated audio from Taeâ€™s videos, and created an original score by combining the two techniques. The result is a stimulating and, at times, distorted composition that travels from the jungle's liveliness to the ocean's calming consistency. Completed all on Ableton Live, this piece was made through a series of passes until we managed to find this unique contrast between the visuals and the music.
